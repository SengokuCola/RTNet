# RTNet: A neural network that exhibits the signatures of human perceptual decision making
The preprint of the paper is avilable [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.23.505015v2.abstract).

## Requirments
The files in this repository should be run on Google Colab. All dependencies will be automatically taken care of when running the code on Coalb. 

## Run the code
The instructions to run the simulations are given at the begining of each notebook. In summary, all you need to do is to provide the path for pretrained models and output path to save the resulting simulations. Once that is done, you are all set. Press Run button. 

## Pretrained models
To download the pretrained models, you can go to our [OSF page](https://osf.io/akwty/).
